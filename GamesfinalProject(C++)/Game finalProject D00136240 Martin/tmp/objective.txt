The king bids you welcome in these troubling times. You sit with him over his table and decline his generous luxuries as you must be brief. You proceed to tell him of the impending threat and implore him to provide men for the cause or you fear that these will be the closing days of Breach and the final hours of the realm of civilized men. The king becomes enraged at this claim, an unmeasured response to the news you have brought and flies off in a flurry of insults and claims of heresy. It is clear that this king is mad. He threatens you and draws his sword. He means to kill you!
 Defend yourself!
