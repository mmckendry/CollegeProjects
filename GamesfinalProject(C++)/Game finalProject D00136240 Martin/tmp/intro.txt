For years you heard the stories the, whispers of a rising power in the east. A nameless threat that weighed heavy on the minds of the people. Though now it’s more than just talk, storm clouds gather, days grow darker and fear becomes a permanent resident in the town of Breach.
  
You receive a letter of summons to the counsel of war. When you arrive, the chambers of the counsel are full of men protesting in alarm and panic it’s clear that this is urgent. As you are seated the lord of Breach turns to you with an arresting stare.

"These are troubled times and each new day brings only more ill news. War is upon us and I dread the days ahead.  News from the afar tells of the destructions of the eastern provinces. Towns are being razed to the ground and soon the enemy will be at our doors. We need you to gather men from neighbouring towns and cities to make a stand against this new danger. You will be our representative. Our consulate of war."
