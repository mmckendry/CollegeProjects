A small game written in C++ to implement hash maps, arrays and persistence(file i/o).
As a result all of the source code is in the "GamesfinalProject(C++)\Game finalProject D00136240 Martin\Hashes\Hashes" directory.

NOTE: Game is not complete there is only a few areas that can be visited and there is limited interaction. A finished game
was not the assignment, implementation of data structures, persistence etc. was.
